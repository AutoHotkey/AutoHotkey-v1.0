		// something like the following example.  Note that the hotkey below must be a hook
		// hotkey (even more rare) because registered hotkeys will still see the logical modifier
		// state and thus fire regardless of whether g_modifiersLR_logical_non_ignored says that
		// they shouldn't:
		// #b::Send, {CtrlDown}{AltDown}
		// $^!a::MsgBox You pressed the A key after pressing the B key.
		// In the above, making ^!a a hook hotkey prevents it from working in conjunction with #b.
		// UPDATE: It seems slightly better to have it be KEY_IGNORE_ALL_EXCEPT_MODIFIER for these reasons:
		// 1) Persistent modifiers are fairly rare.  When they're in effect, it's usually for a reason
		//    and probably a pretty good one and from a user who knows what they're doing.
		// 2) The condition that g_modifiersLR_logical_non_ignored was added to fix occurs only when
		//    the user physically presses a suffix key (or auto-repeats one by holding it down)
		//    during the course of a SendKeys() operation.  Since the persistent modifiers were
		//    (by definition) already in effect prior to the Send, putting them back down for the
		//    purpose of firing hook hotkeys does not seem unreasonable, and may in fact add value.
		// Also, the below is called with "false" to avoid generating unnecessary disguise-keystrokes.

		// release of the WIN or ALT key will already be disguised due to its having modified

	// Control won't be going down if aEventType==KEYUP because nothing is ever pressed down in that mode.

	// To prevent it from activating the menu bar, the release of the ALT key should be disguised
	// unless a CTRL key is currently down.  This is because CTRL always seems to avoid the
	// activation of the menu bar (unlike SHIFT, which sometimes allows the menu to be activated,
	// though this is hard to reproduce on XP).  Another reason not to use SHIFT is that the OS
	// uses LAlt+Shift as a hotkey to switch languages.  Such a hotkey would be triggered if SHIFT
	// were pressed down to disguise the release of LALT.

	// Alt-down events are also disguised whenever they won't be accompanied by a Ctrl-down.
	// This is necessary whenever our caller does not plan to disguise the key itself.  For example,
	// if "!a::Send Test" is a registered hotkey, two things must be done to avoid complications:
	// 1) Prior to sending the word test, ALT must be released in a way that does not activate the
	//    menu bar.  This is done by sandwiching it between a CTRL-down and a CTRL-up.
	// 2) After the send is complete, SendKeys() will restore the ALT key to the down position if
	//    the user is still physically holding ALT down (this is done to make the logical state of
	//    the key match its physical state, which allows the same hotkey to be fired twice in a row
	//    without the user having to release and press down the ALT key physically).
	// The #2 case above is the one handled below by ctrl_wont_be_down.  It is especially necessary
	// when the user releases the ALT key prior to releasing the hotkey suffix, which would otherwise
	// cause the menu bar (if any) of the active window to be activated.
	bool disguise_alt_key = ctrl_not_down && ctrl_wont_be_down; // Since this applies to both Left and Right Alt, don't take g_LayoutHasAltGr into account here. That is done later below.

	// Some of the same comments above for ALT key apply to the WIN key.  More about this issue:
	// Although the disguise of the down-event is usually not needed, it is needed in the rare case
	// where the user releases the WIN or ALT key prior to releasing the hotkey's suffix.
	// Although the hook could be told to disguise the physical release of ALT or WIN in these
	// cases, it's best not to rely on the hook since it is not always installed.

	// Registered WIN and ALT hotkeys that don't use the Send command work okay except ALT hotkeys,
	// which if the user releases ALT prior the hotkey's suffix key, cause the menu bar to be activated.
	// Since it is unusual for users to do this and because it is standard behavior for  ALT hotkeys
	// registered in the OS, fixing it via the hook seems like a low priority, and perhaps isn't worth
	// the added code complexity/size.  But if there is ever a need to do so, the following note applies:
	// If the hook is installed, could tell it to disguise any need-to-be-disguised Alt-up that occurs
	// after receipt of the registered ALT hotkey.  But what if that hotkey uses the send command:
	// there might be intereference?  Doesn't seem so, because the hook only disguises non-ignored events.

	// The WIN key is successfully disguised under a greater number of conditions than ALT:
	bool disguise_win_key = ctrl_not_down && ctrl_wont_be_down
		&& !(aModifiersLRnow & (MOD_LSHIFT | MOD_RSHIFT)) // And neither SHIFT key is down.
		&& (aEventType == KEYUP || !(aModifiersLR & (MOD_LSHIFT | MOD_RSHIFT))) // Nor will it be.

		&& (aEventType == KEYUP || !(aModifiersLR & (MOD_LALT | MOD_RALT))); // Nor will it be.

	// Handle ALT and WIN prior to the other modifiers because the "disguise" methods below are
	// only needed upon release of ALT or WIN.  This is because such releases tend to have a better
	// chance of being "disguised" if SHIFT or CTRL is down at the time of the release.  Thus, the
	// release of SHIFT or CTRL (if called for) is deferred until afterward.
	// Also, WIN is a little more troublesome than ALT, so it is done first in case the ALT key
	// is down but will be going up, since the ALT key being down might help the WIN key.
	// For example, if you hold down CTRL, then hold down LWIN long enough for it to auto-repeat,
	// then release CTRL before releasing LWIN, the Start Menu would appear, at least on XP.
	// But it does not appear if CTRL is released after LWIN.

	// WIN must be handled before ALT because if aEventType indicates that all these keys are being released,
	// we would want to leave ALT down (if it is down and will be going up later) until after LWIN/RWIN

	// A4  038	 	d	0.03	Alt            	
	// 42  030	 	d	0.03	B              	
	// A4  038	 	u	0.24	Alt            	
	// 42  030	 	u	0.19	B              	
	// Testing shows that the above does not happen for a normal (non-hotkey) alt keystroke such as Alt-8,
	// so the above behavior is probably caused by the fact that B-down is suppressed by the OS's hotkey
	// routine, but not B-up.
	// The above also happens with registered WIN hotkeys, but only if the Send cmd resulted in the WIN
	// modifier being pushed back down afterward to match the fact that the user is still holding it down.
	// This behavior applies to ALT hotkeys also.
	// One solution: if the hook is installed, have it keep track of when the start menu or menu bar
	// *would* be activated.  These tracking vars can be consulted by the Send command, and the hook
	// can also be told when to use them after a registered hotkey has been pressed, so that the Alt-up
	// or Win-up keystroke that belongs to it can be disguised.

	// The following are important ways in which other methods of disguise might not be sufficient:
	// Sequence: shift-down win-down shift-up win-up: invokes Start Menu when WIN is held down long enough
	// to auto-repeat.  Same when Ctrl or Alt is used in lieu of Shift.
	// Sequence: shift-down alt-down alt-up shift-up: invokes menu bar.  However, as long as another key,
	// even Shift, is pressed down *after* alt is pressed down, menu bar is not activated, e.g. alt-down
	// shift-down shift-up alt-up.  In addition, CTRL always prevents ALT from activating the menu bar,
	// even with the following sequences:
	// ctrl-down alt-down alt-up ctrl-up
	// alt-down ctrl-down ctrl-up alt-up
	// (also seems true for all other permutations of Ctrl/Alt)

	// such as UP, LEFT, HOME, and PGUP (maybe other sorts of keys too).  This
	// should be okay even on XP because the left/right specific keys have already
	// been resolved above so don't need to be looked up here (LWIN and RWIN
	// each have their own VK's so shouldn't be problem for the below call to resolve):
