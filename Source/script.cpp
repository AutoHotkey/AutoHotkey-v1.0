	// subroutine to be interruptible (it usually runs quickly anyway).  Another reason to make
	// it non-interruptible is that some OnExit subroutines might destruct things used by the
	// script's hotkeys/timers/menu items, and activating these items during the deconstruction
	// would not be safe.  Finally, if a logoff or shutdown is occurring, it seems best to prevent
	// timed subroutines from running -- which might take too much time and prevent the exit from
	// occurring in a timely fashion.  An option can be added via the FutureUse param to make it
	// interruptible if there is ever a demand for that.  UPDATE: g_AllowInterruption is now used
	// instead of g.AllowThisThreadToBeInterrupted for two reasons:
	// 1) It avoids the need to do "int mUninterruptedLineCountMax_prev = g_script.mUninterruptedLineCountMax;"
	//    (Disable this item so that ExecUntil() won't automatically make our new thread uninterruptible
	//    after it has executed a certain number of lines).
	// 2) If the thread we're interrupting is uninterruptible, the uinterruptible timer might be
	//    currently pending.  When it fires, it would make the OnExit subroutine interruptible
	//    rather than the underlying subroutine.  The above fixes the first part of that problem.
	//    The 2nd part is fixed by reinstating the timer when the uninterruptible thread is resumed.
	//    This special handling is only necessary here -- not in other places where new threads are
	//    created -- because OnExit is the only type of thread that can interrupt an uninterruptible

			// questionable, and might be worth further consideration.  UPDATE: g_DerefChar is now

			// - The escape char is backslash.
			// - any instances of \\%, such as c:\\%var% , will not work because the first escape
			// sequence (\\) is resolved to a single literal backslash.  But then when \% is encountered
			// by the section that resolves escape sequences for g_DerefChar, the backslash is seen
			// as an escape char rather than a literal backslash, which is not correct.  Thus, we
			// resolve all escapes sequences HERE in one go, from left to right.

			// AutoIt2 definitely treats an escape char that occurs at the very end of
			// a line as literal.  It seems best to also do it for these other cases too.
			// UPDATE: I cannot reproduce the above behavior in AutoIt2.  Maybe it only
			// does it for some commands or maybe I was mistaken.  So for now, this part

		//    in tight script loops even when MsgSleep(-1) or (0) was called ever 10ms or so.
		// 2) The app is maximally responsive while executing with a high or infinite BatchLines.
		// 3) Hotkeys are maximally responsive.  For example, if a user has game hotkeys, using
		//    a GetTickCount() method (which very slightly improves performance by cutting back on
		//    the number of Peek() calls) would introduce up to 10ms of delay before the hotkey
		//    finally takes effect.  10ms can be significant in games, where ping (latency) itself
		//    can sometimes be only 10 or 20ms.
		// 4) Timed subroutines are run as consistently as possible (to help with this, a check
		//    similar to the below is also done for single commmands that take a long time, such
		//    as URLDownloadToFile, FileSetAttrib, etc.

	// UPDATE: It seems better to store all unsigned values as signed within script

	// ATOI(), the outcome won't be as useful.  In other words, since the negative value
	// will be properly converted by ATOI(), comparing two negative tickcounts works
